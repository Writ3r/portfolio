# React Portfolio

My personal portfolio in React.

## Notable points

- Uses Typescript
- Uses MDBootstrap to build the layout

## Bug workaround
- Use some custom MDB components to workaround react-dom versions

## Contributing
I doubt anyone except potential employers will ever see this.

But hey, if they do, feel free to make a PR as long as it doesn't break anything.
